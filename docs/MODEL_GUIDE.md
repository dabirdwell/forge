### 🆕 Qwen Image 2.0 (Best Text Rendering)

Qwen Image 2.0 is a 20B parameter image model with **best-in-class text rendering**. It can generate posters, infographics, comics, and any image requiring professional typography in English, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.

| Component | Size | Download |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Diffusion Model (FP8) | ~13 GB | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image_ComfyUI/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/qwen_image_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors) |
| Text Encoder (FP8) | ~8 GB | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image_ComfyUI/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors) |
| VAE | ~0.2 GB | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image_ComfyUI/resolve/main/split_files/vae/qwen_image_vae.safetensors) |
| 4-Step LoRA (optional) | ~0.5 GB | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning/resolve/main/Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V1.0.safetensors) |

**File placement:**
- Diffusion model → `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/`
- Text encoder → `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders/`
- VAE → `ComfyUI/models/vae/`
- LoRA (optional) → `ComfyUI/models/loras/`

**RAM requirement:** 16GB+ recommended (FP8 quantization). 24GB+ for best quality.

**Tips:**
- Use 20 steps, CFG 2.5, euler sampler for FP8 model
- With 4-step LoRA: 4 steps, CFG 1.0 (much faster, slight quality tradeoff)
- Supports native 2K resolution and all common aspect ratios
- For text-heavy prompts, be specific about layout, font style, and placement

### 🔍 Upscalers (for Image Upscale mode)

| Model | Size | Best For | Download |

## Tips

### Memory Management

NeoVak shows memory warnings if a model might not fit:
- 🟢 Green = Should work fine
- 🟡 Yellow = Might be tight, close other apps
- 🟠 Orange = Risky, may fail or be slow
- 🔴 Red = Probably won't work

### Model Naming

NeoVak auto-detects model types from names:
- `lightning` → Uses 4 steps, low CFG
- `turbo` → Uses 4-8 steps, low CFG
- `xl` or `sdxl` → Uses SDXL settings
- Other → Standard SD 1.5 settings

### Downloading from CivitAI

1. Find a model you like
2. Click "Download"
3. Choose the `.safetensors` file (not `.ckpt` if available)
4. Move to appropriate folder
5. Restart NeoVak or click "Rescan for models"

### Downloading from HuggingFace

1. Navigate to the model page
2. Go to "Files and versions" tab
3. Download the `.safetensors` file
4. Move to appropriate folder

## Troubleshooting

### "No models found"
- Check that files are in `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/`
- Make sure file extension is `.safetensors` or `.ckpt`
- Click "Rescan for models" in NeoVak

### Model shows but won't load
- Check RAM requirements
- Try starting ComfyUI with `--force-fp32`
- Close other memory-heavy applications

### Which model should I start with?
- 8GB RAM: DreamShaper 8 (2GB)
- 16GB RAM: SDXL Lightning (6.5GB)
- 24GB+ RAM: Any model should work
