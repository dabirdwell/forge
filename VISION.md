# NeoVak Vision: LM Studio for Multimedia

*Making local AI media generation accessible to everyone*

## The Gap

LM Studio proved that local AI doesn't require technical expertise. Download an app, pick a model, start chatting. No terminal, no Python environments, no VRAM calculations.

**Nothing equivalent exists for creative media.**

- ComfyUI: Powerful but intimidating node-based interface
- Automatic1111: Learning curve, configuration complexity  
- Wan2GP: Still requires conda, git, CUDA debugging
- RunwayML/Pika: Cloud-only, subscription, privacy concerns

The person who uses LM Studio to draft emails can't generate a birthday video for their kid locally. That's the gap NeoVak fills.

## Target User

Someone who:
- Has never opened a terminal
- Doesn't know what VRAM means
- Wants to create images/videos/audio locally
- Values privacy and ownership
- Would pay for simplicity

**Not** targeting:
- ComfyUI power users (they're already served)
- People who enjoy technical configuration
- Enterprise/API use cases

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero Configuration
Hardware detection is automatic. Model selection is guided. Defaults just work.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Simple mode shows: prompt, generate button, output. Advanced mode reveals parameters. Expert mode exposes everything.

### 3. Unified Experience
Same interaction patterns whether generating an image, video, or audio clip. Learn once, apply everywhere.

### 4. Local First
Everything runs on your hardware. No accounts, no cloud, no subscriptions. Your creations stay yours.

## Design Language

NeoVak's aesthetic is inspired by vacuum tube technology from *Lumina's Whisper* - warm amber glows, analog indicators, retro-futuristic controls. The philosophy: **warm, analog, alive**.
